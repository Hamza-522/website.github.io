                    Khunjerab National Park is a national park in Gilgit Baltistan, Pakistan. Khunjerab National Park is Pakistan's third largest national park, and is adjacent to the Taxkorgan Natural Reserve in China.Khunjerab National Park was established primarily as a means to protect the Marco Polo sheep (as well as snow leopards and bharal) living in the area The borders of the park were mapped by Schaller in 1974, after a short field survey. The park was formally established on 29 April 1975 by Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who said that "it must become a world famous Despite being listed as a category 2 national park, banning human activities including agriculture and hunting, the park was poorly managed, meaning that illegal hunting of the Marco Polo sheep continued. Because of this, the International Union for Conservation of Nature commissioned Norwegian biologist Per Wegge to do a wildlife survey of the park in 1988.[4] Wegge found that there was no evidence of competition between the domestic sheep being illegally grazed and the wild Marco Polo sheep</p>
                    <p class="text-center" id="text" data-aos="fade-up">The Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea are also to the south.The park’s unique rock formations have been attracting tourists from all over the country for some time - notably since the completion of the Makran Coastal Highway in 2004.Wildlife

                    <p id="text" data-aos="fade-up">and that most of the illegal hunting was not being done by local Wakhi residents.[4] He therefore proposed that the park be reclassified, allowing grazing and commercial hunting, with the profits going to local residents. However, the government overlooked Wegge's suggestions, instead drawing up a new management plan, which both the IUCN and the World Wildlife Fund supported as a means to preserve the park and protect the wildlife. Wegge was critical of the government scheme, claiming that it was based on financial considerations, with the Pakistani government hoping to attract tourists to the area. The IUCN agreed with this, and has since distanced itself from the national park.[5] To help protect the animals from poaching, the WWF has created the Khunzerav Village Organization, which relies on people living in the area to report poaching or endangered animal sightings.[6] This park was created on 29 April 1975 on the recommendation of wildlife biologist Dr. George Schaller. Over half of the park is above 4,000 m. Khunjerab Pass, the gateway to China via the Karakoram Highway, is at 4,934 m.

                      Whether you are travelling from any city in Pakistan or from outside the country, you will need to get to Karachi first to go to Hingol National Park. Located at a distance of 243 kilometers from Karachi, it will take you around 3.5 hours to reach the park if you are travelling by car via Makran Coastal Highway (N-25).

                  <p class="text-center" id="text" data-aos="fade-up">Khunjerab National Park is spread across an area of 2, 27,143 , and at an elevation of 17,000 ft within the Karakorum-West Tibetan biodiversity region, amidst the Karakorum Range Mountains on Pakistan-China border in Upper Hunza. The National Park is home to alpine flora along with many endangered and threatened species and boasts to be the 3rd largest national park in Pakistan. Wildlife includes, Snow leopard (Threatened), Marco polo Sheep (Endangered), Himalayan Ibex, Blue Sheep, Siberian Ibex, Brown Bear (Threatened), Blue Sheep (Vulnerable).66 Species of birds found: Golden Eagle, Himalayan Snowcock, Himalayan Griffon vulture (Near Threatened).</p>
                  <p class="text-center" id="text" data-aos="fade-up">The primary purpose of this park was to provide protection to the endangered Marco Polo sheep, which is only found in this area in Pakistan. According to the Mir of Hunza, the population of sheep was around 400 but had dropped to below 180 by the time of the completion of the Karakoram Highway. A herd of almost 75 Marco Polo sheep was recorded in the spring of 1984 and park staff saw at least 50 crossing the pass in May 1989. </p>
                  <p class="text-center" id="text" data-aos="fade-up">The park is also famous for its snow leopards. Some reports say that it might contain the highest density of these beautiful cats in the total Himalayan ecosystem, which is the natural habitat of these cats. Over 2,000 Siberian ibex, widely distributed and abundant in the park but absent from neighbouring China, are also present here.

                    Feral or semi-feral animals especially domestic yaks can be seen roaming in the park. </p>
